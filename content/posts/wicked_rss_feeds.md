I recently had the opportunity to meet with a few aspiring cybersecurity students and talk to them about the virtues of IDSes, IPSes, Firewalls, Honey Pots, and compensating controls. It was a blast, and it's clear that the future is in good hands with these professionals at the wheel.

After my little talk, I told them about a tool that would help them learn how to hack WiFi even if they didn't have equipment. I had gotten the knowledge from [Black Hill's Security Blog](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/blog/). I asked if any of the students had heard of Black Hills, and they said. "No". I responded that Black Hills was one of my favorite blogs that came across my RSS feed. I saw some puzzled looks.

I then asked the students if they had ever heard of RSS. Some of them responded, "yes", but most shook their heads. I spent a few minutes showing them how to find RSS feeds on a page, then how to add them to a reader program. Pretty standard.

But I got asked in the class what feeds I would recommend them to look into and I didn't have a list. They asked if I could compile a list of resources for cybersecurity students so that they can get on top of things. So this is my attempt.

# How to do RSS

Although I've done [an article on this before](https://firedfox.netlify.app/posts/rss_ftw/), I was asked in class how to set up an RSS reader.

For those who want to [use a commercial solution, I recommend this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_ZvlvQof34)

For those who want to do [Everything on the command line like a hacker or Linux Chad, I recommend this video from Luke Smith.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMH9w6pyzvU).

# Formatting

I will be copying lines from my URLS file for newsboat. This isn't a format that's compatible with most readers, but the links can be copy-pasted into an RSS reader. I will also separate them into categories in the headings. This is by no means a comprehensive list of all the links in my feed, but it's a good starting point for someone who doesn't know where to begin.

Note: Job Boards and Podcasts will be light since I don't typically use these, but I want to show students what's possible.

# Summary

So yeah, Enjoy. Once you get a taste of how powerful RSS is for creating your own cyber feed, I know you'll want to stick with it and curate your own news sources.

Pro Tip: Even if you don't like some of these, look for references to other blogs, news sites and youtube channels. The community is very small and we all cross pollinate with other professionals.
